# CLAUDE.md — LedgerMatch — Payment Reconciliation Platform

## Project Overview

A payment reconciliation dashboard that matches internal payment records against external provider data (Stripe, PayPal, bank transfers). Built as a portfolio project demonstrating full-stack development with real-world fintech patterns.

## Tech Stack

- **Backend:** Python 3.12+, FastAPI, SQLAlchemy (async), Pydantic v2, PostgreSQL 16
- **Frontend:** React 19, TypeScript 5, Vite 8, TanStack Query + Table, shadcn/ui, Tailwind CSS v4
- **Infrastructure:** Docker Compose (PostgreSQL, n8n, API, Web)
- **Testing:** pytest (API), Vitest (Web)
- **Bonus:** LangChain for natural language queries

## Project Structure

```
apps/api/          # FastAPI backend
apps/web/          # React frontend
n8n/workflows/     # Exported n8n workflow JSON files
docker-compose.yml # Full stack orchestration
```

### Backend Layout (`apps/api/app/`)

Each domain entity follows the pattern: `entity/` with model, service, router modules.

- `common/` — Shared utilities (code generation, etc.)
- `currency/`, `provider/`, `merchant/` — Reference data entities
- `payment/` — Internal payment records (source of truth)
- `stripe/`, `paypal/`, `bank/` — External provider payment records
- `reconciliation/` — Reconciliation engine and results
- `ask/` — LangChain NL query endpoint (bonus)
- `seed/` — Seed data service
- `database.py` — SQLAlchemy async engine and session
- `main.py` — FastAPI app entry point

## Conventions

### General

- All monetary amounts are stored in **minor units (cents)** — never floats
- UUIDs for all primary keys
- Human-readable codes with format `PREFIX-YYYY-MM-SEQUENCE` (e.g., `PAY-2026-03-000012`)
- Soft deletes via `disabledAt` nullable datetime (not hard deletes)
- All tables include `createdAt` and `updatedAt` timestamps

### Python / Backend

- Use **async** SQLAlchemy sessions and FastAPI async endpoints
- Pydantic v2 for all request/response validation
- One router per entity domain, mounted in `main.py`
- `.http` files in `apps/api/http/` for VS Code REST Client testing
- Snake_case for Python code, camelCase for JSON API responses (Pydantic alias)

### TypeScript / Frontend

- Strict TypeScript — no `any` types
- TanStack Query for all server state (no local state for API data)
- TanStack Table for data grids with sorting, filtering, pagination
- shadcn/ui components — do not build custom UI primitives
- API types in `src/types/`

### Database

- PostgreSQL 16 with async driver (asyncpg)
- Tables created on app startup via SQLAlchemy `create_all`
- Enums defined as PostgreSQL enums: `paymentStatus`, `paymentMethod`, `reconciliationStatus`, `stripePaymentType`, `paypalPaymentType`, `bankTransferType`
- Foreign keys reference UUIDs; card/IBAN fields are mutually exclusive per payment method

### Testing

- `pytest` with async support for API tests
- `vitest` for frontend component and hook tests
- Tests live in `apps/api/tests/` and alongside frontend source files

### Docker

- `docker compose up` must start the full stack (PostgreSQL, n8n, API, Web)
- PostgreSQL on port 5432, n8n on port 5678
- n8n workflows exported as JSON in `n8n/workflows/`

## Collaboration Rules

- **Do not start coding when the user asks a question.** When the user asks "what do you think?" or discusses an approach, reply with your analysis and wait for confirmation before making any changes. Only start developing when explicitly asked to proceed.

## Key Design Decisions

- **Scoring-based reconciliation** over exact key matching — real-world payments rarely have perfect matching keys
- **Separate provider tables** (stripe_payments, paypal_payments, bank_transfer_payments) over polymorphic single table — each provider has unique fields
- **n8n for workflow automation** over coded cron jobs — visual workflows are easier to monitor and modify
- **code_sequences table** for human-readable code generation with uniqueness guarantees

## Commands

```bash
# Backend
cd apps/api && pip install -r requirements.txt
cd apps/api && python -m pytest

# Frontend
cd apps/web && npm install
cd apps/web && npm run dev
cd apps/web && npx vitest

# Full stack
docker compose up
```
